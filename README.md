## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. I had a little trouble aligning my textViews to keep the display organized. 
2. I didn't really understand how to use functions from the FourWordLetterList kotlin text file that was provided to me.
3. It was difficult for me to display the guesses that the user would input because I couldn't figure out how to link the button with the textViews where the guesses 
   are supposed to be placed.
