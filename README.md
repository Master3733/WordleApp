## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. I had a little trouble aligning my textViews to keep the display organized. 
2. I didn't really understand how to call the functions from the FourWordLetterList kotlin text file that was provided to me.
3. It was difficult for me to display the guesses that the user would input because I couldn't figure out how to link the inputted text with the textViews where the users' guesses are supposed to be placed.
